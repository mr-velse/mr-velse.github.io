Primarily made up of graduates from Manchester University and other nearby universities, the band was formed in 2013 to provide an opportunity to continue playing at an advanced level after leaving university. Running as a one-per-part wind orchestra, the band is able to maintain a high standard of playing whilst exploring a wide range of repertoire. We are a very sociable group and we often have vacancies in some sections of the band where trial periods are offered to prospective new players. Please get in contact if you would like more information about this.
